Requirements
Python: The application is written in Python. You need Python installed on your computer. You can download it from python.org.
Dependencies: The app requires several Python libraries, including Streamlit, Pandas, and Statsmodels. These can be installed using pip.
Installation Steps
Install Python:

Download Python from python.org.
Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
Set Up the Environment:

It's recommended to use a virtual environment. Create one by running python -m venv venv in your terminal.
Activate the virtual environment:
Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate
Install Required Libraries:

Install the necessary libraries using pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install streamlit pandas statsmodels matplotlib seaborn tensorflow
Download the Project Files:

Ensure you have the following files:
The Streamlit app script (e.g., app.py).
The trained model file (model.pkl).
Running the App:

Navigate to the directory containing your Streamlit script.
Run the app using Streamlit:
bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Your default web browser should open automatically with the app running. If it doesn't, the terminal will provide a local URL you can use to access the app.
Using the App
User Interface:
Select a month from the dropdown menu.
Choose whether you want to see predictions for each day or the average for the month.
Click on "Start Prediction" to view the results.
Interpreting Results:
The app will display the number of scanned receipts predicted for the selected period.
Troubleshooting
If you encounter errors related to missing libraries, ensure all required libraries are installed.
If the model file (model.pkl) is not found, ensure it's in the same directory as the Streamlit script or update the script with the correct file path.
For any issues with Python installation or package management, refer to the official Python documentation.
